Supposed to replace 'site request' & 'site reqfilled' on site
and add !request, !reqfilled & !requests functions to irc.
( !reqdel and !reqwipe too )

Can also delete requests if they are older then a of days
and unfilled, as well as deleting those that ARE filled after
a (different?) number of days.
